## Overview

The concept of [Snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre))
(the video game) has been around since 1976â€“when the video game Blockade
invented the genre. However, it saw a new popularity and ultimately rose to
prominence after the launch of Nokia's 6110 mobile phone in 1997. Its popularity
exploded, leading to many spin-offs and coming preloaded on the majority of
Nokia's subsequent phones. This ultimately cemented Snake's place in the arcade
hall-of-fame, where it resides to this day.

This validator should have a simple HTTP API allowing clients to implement their
own snake games, and allowing our hardware team to implement it on the Solo
reader.

API will be used to prevent cheating, and to make sure that a given set of
moves leads to a valid outcome; thus maintaining trust in our highly competitive
global leaderboard.

- The snake will never be longer than length 1. It will *not* grow after eating
    a fruit.
- You will only have 1 single fruit at a time on the game board.
- If the snake hits the edge of the game bounds, the game is over.
- The snake will always start at position `(0, 0)`, with a velocity of `(1, 0)`.
    - i.e. at `x=0`, `y=0` moving to the *right*.

The client will make an initial call to the validator to start a new game with
the provided parameters. It will then collect a series of "ticks", containing
moves that will lead the snake to the position of the fruit. A tick is a single
movement of the snake in a given (x, y) direction. Once the moves lead the snake
to the fruit, the game state and ticks are sent back to your validator in order
to confirm that the move-set is valid. If they are valid, the validator will
increment the game's score, generate a new position for the fruit and send back
the new game state, and so on and so forth.

## Requirements

The validator should expose a web server with two routes. The server itself
should be stateless.

- `GET /new?w=[width]&h=[height]`:
    - Query Params:
        - `w: int`
        - `h: int`
    - Response:
        - *200*: JSON marshalled `state`, with randomly generated fruit
            position.
        - *400*: Invalid request.
        - *405*: Invalid method.
        - *500*: Internal server error.

<br />

- `POST /validate`: 
    - JSON Body:
    ```go
    {
        ...state // all fields in state type
        ticks: [
            { velX: int, velY: int }, // velocity at that tick
            ...
        ]
    }
    ```
    - Response:
        - *200*: Valid state & ticks. Returns JSON marshalled `state` with new
            randomly generated fruit position and a score incremented by 1.
        - *400*: Invalid request.
        - *404*: Fruit not found, the ticks do not lead the snake to the fruit
            position.
        - *405*: Invalid method.
        - *418*: Game is over, snake went out of bounds or made an invalid move. 
        - *500*: Internal server error.

#### Types
```go
type state struct {
	GameID string `json:"gameId"`
	Width  int    `json:"width"`
	Height int    `json:"height"`
	Score  int    `json:"score"`
	Fruit  fruit  `json:"fruit"`
	Snake  snake  `json:"snake"`
}

type fruit struct {
	X int `json:"x"`
	Y int `json:"y"`
}

type snake struct {
	X    int `json:"x"`
	Y    int `json:"y"`
	VelX int `json:"velX"` // X velocity of the snake (-1, 0, 1)
	VelY int `json:"velY"` // Y velocity of the snake (-1, 0, 1)
}
```

#### Velocity

The snake maintains its movement in a given direction until it is given an
instruction to change it. The format of this velocity is `(x, y)`, where `x` is
the velocity in the `x` direction and `y` is the velocity in the `y` direction.
Velocity values can be one of `-1`, moving left/up, `0`, no movement for axis,
`1`, down/right. 

#### Movement

In the rules of Snake, only certain movements are possible at each time. For
example, when the snake is moving to the right, velocity `(1, 0)`, it is
impossible for it to do an immediate 180-degree turn to velocity `(-1, 0)`.
Calls to `/validate` with these sorts of invalid moves should return the invalid
response.
